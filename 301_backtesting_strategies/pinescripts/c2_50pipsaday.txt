// One of the latest Forex trading strategies to be used is the 50-pips a day Forex strategy which leverages the early market move of certain highly liquid currency pairs. 
// The GBPUSD and EURUSD currency pairs are some of the best currencies to trade using this particular strategy. 

// After the 7am GMT candlestick closes, traders place two positions or two opposite pending orders.
// When one of them gets activated by price movements, the other position is automatically cancelled.

// The profit target is set at 50 pips, and the stop-loss order is placed anywhere between 5 and 10 pips above or below the 7am GMT candlestick, after its formation. 
// This is implemented to manage risk. After these conditions are set, it is now up to the market to do the rest. 
// Day trading and scalping are both short-term trading strategies. 
// However, remember that shorter-term implies greater risk due to the nature of more trades taken, so it is essential to ensure effective risk management.
